# PRODIGY_CS_03
# Password Complexity Checker

A simple Python tool that checks the strength of a password based on security criteria like length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters and it provides feedback to users on the password's stregnth.

# How it works

The script checks if the password:
- Has at least 8 characters
- Includes uppercase letters
- Includes lowercase letters
- Contains numbers
- Contains special characters

It then gives a strength score and suggestions to improve the password.

##  How to run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run the script in terminal:

```bash
python password_complexity_checker.py
